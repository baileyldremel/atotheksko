            <h2>Assignment 1: Reflect</h2>
            <h3>Looking back and reflecting on what I have done</h3>
            <p>Now that it has been a couple of weeks and I have received my marks, I understand what I have done well and what I could improve on. I really enjoyed task, even though I struggled with the execution and understanding what it was asking of me at the beginning. From the feedback I got, I know now that I am in a typography class and that the typography, I make should be front and centre, not competing with other typefaces (such as the Climate typeface I added for the titles). I didnâ€™t think of my forms as actors playing roles but that brings up opportunities for building typefaces.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Although this typeface is a great experimentation, I struggle to find a way to convert that concept into a full typeface. It would have to involve a user having to twist and turn the typeface on their devices and it would be hard to convey my idea into a flat form. It would just end up as static letters, which defeats the purpose of the 3d typeface I had made.</p>
